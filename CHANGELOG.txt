1/21/2017 15:40: I started the program.
1/21/2017 16:20: I finshed the main method and display method and started working on generateRooms method.
1/21/2017 17:01: I have mostly finished the generateRooms method and am doing bug fixes.
1/22/2017 13:55: I fixed the generateRooms method and started on the generateHalls method.
1/22/2017 14:57: generateHalls mostly works. It has a bug where not all halls finish generating. I also created the Makefile.
1/24/2017 09:31: I reworte generateHalls from scratch and it works as intended. I may add more features before creating the tar.
1/29/2017 20:15: I reworte my first project to have a room struct which required me to adjust all of the methods.
1/31/2017 20:48: I wrote the save and load functions. I believe save works as intended since it contains the correct amount of bits for a file
		 load causes a segfault so I am unable to test to see if it works.
2/01/2017 14:47: The save functions sometimes cuases the program to segfualt. I had the program print of the seed it is using before running
		 save and using the exact same seed will sometimes work. I have no idea what is cuasing this.
2/01/2017 19:15: The load function works correctly since I'm able to load other student's dungeon. The save function doesn't work.
2/01/2017 19:32: The save function works with my load function. I will test my load function with more files before submiting
2/01/2017 19:36: My program works with the test files so it works as intended.
2/05/2017 11:45: I added a placepc method that places the playable character in a random room in the dungeon.
2/07/2017 13:27: I abboned my code for the most part and started using Jeremy's code. I was able to copy of some of my work. I think I am close
		 to getting Dijkstra's algorithm to work on the non-tunneling distance map.
2/14/2017 18:01: I stopped procastanting this project and came back to fix my methods that calculate the distance for non-tunneling monsters and
		 to correctly display that distance map.
2/14/2017 18:11: I coppied the 2 methods above and slightly altered them to get the display map for the tunneling monsters to work correctly.
2/14/2017 19:00: After updating the readme, improving my comments, and testing about 15 different seeds I believe the project works as intened
		 and have submitted it.
2/19/2017 14:00: I added two structs: node and queue to the previous project. I also added 2 new switches --nummon <int> and --distance. I 
		 declared a new method generateMonsters() but havn't wrote anything for it yet.
2/19/2017 20:47: I added a new terrian type monster and changed all of the render/display methods to be able to display monsters at their postions.
		 I also fixed a bug that was cuasing an inncorrect number of monsters to be generated.
2/19/2017 22:27: I added the following methods: playGame, moveMon, movePC, killM, and badSort. badSort works and the others may work but I can't 
		 test any of the others until I have finished writing them.
2/20/2017 21:15: I worked on a lot of bug fixing stuff today. I have created a lot of methods for moving different types of monsters and tommorow
		 I will try to find ways of optomizing them. I still need to make my event queue sort by next turn and not just by speed.
2/22/2017 21:55: I tweaked a lot of methods and fixed some bugs but it doesn't work as indended so I need to submit what I have.
2/22/2017 23:13: More bug fixes and methods added to the project so more of the monsters move correctly. Project still doesn't work as intended.
2/23/2017 01:52: More bug fixes. It still doesn't work but I'm too tired to fix it.
2/28/2017 09:06: I messed around with Jermey's soultion to 1.04 to better understand how his code works.
2/27/2017 22:16: I added ncurses to the makefile.
3/02/2017 22:30: I tried rewriting render dungeon with ncurses but I keep seg fualting.
3/06/2017 19:22: I fixed render dungeon to correctly render the dungeon
3/06/2017 22:49: The previous post was a lie, render dungeon now works correctly.
3/06/2017 23:39: Added movement functionality.
3/07/2017 17:43: Added stairs functionality. I did not save a dungeon if you revisit a floor.
3/07/2017 20:20: Added the look functionality so all of the commands work correctly. The death and victory messages are broken currently however.
3/07/2017 20:49: Project works as intended.
3/20/2017 20:49: Updated the header files to work with CPP.
3/20/2017 21:51: Replaced structs with classes.
3/21/2017 15:05: Changed the dungeon and rlg327 files to work with c++ code.
3/21/2017 10:28: Lots of bug fixes.
3/22/2017 21:11: I was able to get the program to compile with c++ code. For some reason all of my cpp files need extra closing curly brackets
		 and I have no idea why. I"m still testing for runtime errors.
3/22/2017 23:23: Fog of war works and I fixed all of the runtime errors.
3/27/2017 ??:??: I finished converting all c files to cpp files by the end of the day.
3/28/2017 21:29: Project works as intended.
4/04/2017 20:00: I created object.cpp and object.h which contains an object class. It doesn't work yet.
4/05/2017 22:00: Monsters have been updated to work as the pdf specifies.
4/06/2017 00:42: Project works as intended.
4/11/2017 19:05: PC can now pick up objects.
4/11/2017 20:16: Player can now view their inventory.
4/11/2017 20:59: Player can now inspect items in their inventory.
4/11/2017 22:06: skeleton code for the rest of the program implemented.
4/12/2017 19:13: Player can expunge items from their inventory.
4/12/2017 20:11: Player can equip items and view their equipment.
4/12/2017 21:02: Player can take off items.
4/12/2017 21:18: Player can drop items.
4/12/2017 21:40: Monsters can no longer attack each other.
4/12/2017 21:58: Project works as intended.
4/18/2017 20:30: Shopkeeps appeer in dungeon and the PC can buy stuff from them. PC can also expunge items for money.
4/19/2017 22:04: Weight of items now affects the PC's speed and the Player can look at their stats by pressing !.
4/19/2017 22:23: Defence of items now reduces damage dealt by monsters to the player.
4/21/2017 11:25: Characters recover 10% of their health every 5 turns.
